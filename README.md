# Victor Alliu
I'm Victor Alliu from Nigeria, preferring to be addressed as "Scofvial," 
which is a blend of my names. Currently, I'm a student at Babcock 
University, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
Additionally, I'm simultaneously advancing my skills in software 
engineering as a student at Alx Africa. I possess a profound passion for 
technology and excel in diagnosing both hardware and software issues. My 
dedication is firmly rooted in the field of Software Engineering, and I am 
committed to continuous learning and skill acquisition. My ultimate goal is 
to thrive as an IT Technician by further expanding my knowledge and gaining 
invaluable practical experience.
